# Statistical-Computing-with-R-Python
1. Understand the inner workings of common R and Python function (e.g. lm in R) and use
this knowledge to optimize code.
2. Learn and implement common optimization algorithms (e.g. EM, MM, Newton). Understand their application to common statistical models (eg non–linear regression, mixture
models).
3. Understand the importance and challenge of numerical matrix inversion for statistical
applications. Implement computational strategies to avoid, speed up, and stabilize matrix
inversion.
4. Understand common data structures in Python and R (vectors, matrices, arrays, lists,
dataframes) and their various strengths and weaknesses.
5. Provide several examples of the quote “The form of a mathematical expression and the
way the expression should be evaluated in actual practice may be quite different” (J.
Gentle)
6. Design and implement simulation studies in R and Python.
7. Produce reproducible research reports in clear, well–documented R and Python code.
